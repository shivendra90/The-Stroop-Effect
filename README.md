## The Stroop Effect

The Stroop Effect is a psychological test that was invented Dr. John Ridley Stroop, upon whose the name has been derived from. Its a simple test that involves test subjects speaking the colour of a word rather than the word itself. Its an interesting test that takes only a couple of minutes where the subject is required to record his/her time to finish a passage of these confusing lines and calculate the difference in total timings in phase I of the test, where the subject is provided with the words highlighted in their true colour, and phase II where the subjects are required to read the colour instead of the listed noun. The lower the difference, higher is the score.

In this manner, psychologists are able to peek inside and comment on a test subject's processing speed and concentrating abilities.

### About this Project

This repository contains just two files, the main being the PDF with its markdown assistant provided as a .Rmd file. The Stroop Effect is the 2nd project of the MLF course at Udacity where a student is required to research on this topic as well as to comment on the differences provided in a small dataset that has some 24 observations of test subjects.

The rubric requires submissions to conduct meaningful statistical tests on the available data. The best that one can carry out is commenting on the significance of differences between the mean calculations of the `Congruent` and `Incongruent` variables. The experiment is divided into a congruent phase which is phase I and the later stage, phase II that tests the incongruent phase of the experiment. This in addition to carrying out efficient statistical descriptions are the two primary objectives of this project.

### Conducting in R

The PDF available in this repo contains R code. The reason for selecting R is because it has inbuilt functionalities that provide an edge into conducting statistical analysis when compared to Python that has to have modules such as `numpy`, `scipy` and `statsmodels` loaded in the kernel. This poses a limitation when someone uses only a limited version of Python and has to be installed from outside. Another reason for choosing R was that it provided me a ground for comparing on how the two languages feel. After finishing the document, I was of the opinion that the two are almost the same and that is great for any practicing analyst.

### End Results

The results of this PDF were interesting. There were also several other meanings that came out. When first conducted, it was concluded that there is a vast difference between mean timings of congruent words and mean timings of incongruent words. It was further concluded from this difference in values that there is very little correlation between a person speaking congruent words and fairing high on the incongruent phase. It was almost negligible. However, there is some fact to it that a normal performance in the first phase of the experiment can lead to some minor improvement in phase II of the project.

Please note that this document used the latest iteration of R. For imitating similar results, it is always advisable to use the latest version.
